## Area Between a Curve and the X Axis

To find the area between a curve and the x-axis, the most preferred tool is [definite integration](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/integration-definite.html) of the given curve.

To find the area under the curve y = f(x) between x = a and x = b, integrate y = f(x) between the limits of a and b.

## Some Examples

Curves which are entirely above the x-axis.

NOTE: Areas under the x-axis will come out negative and areas above the x-axis will be positive. This means that you have to be careful when finding an area which is partly above and partly below the x-axis.
